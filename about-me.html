    <h1>about me.</h1>

    <p>Welcome to my photography website! I'm Jaden Chee, a media and tech enthusiast with a knack for storytelling. I'm skilled in digital communication, design, and data visualization, with experience in tools like Adobe Creative Suite and Microsoft Office.</p>

    <p>As a student at Duke Kunshan University, I'm exploring the intersection of creativity and technology, as well as building skills in project management and communication. My educational journey spans from my basement in South Shore Massachusetts to Duke University, IES Barcelona in Spain, and currently Duke Kunshan University in Suzhou, China, where I'm pursuing dual-degrees in <u>Interdisciplinary Studies</u> and <u>Computation and Design: Digital Media.</u></p>

    <p>Professionally, I've worked as a Research Assistant, led design projects as the head of design for multiple clubs, as well as founding my own Design Collective as a club at my university. I've also volunteered at the Montreux Jazz Festival and the Shanghai Biennale, gaining experience in event management.</p>

    <p>I'm also a freelance photographer (as you've just seen) and the founder of "Verse for Change," a small business and non-profit venture focused on social causes.</p>

    <p>If you're looking for a creative collaborator with an eye for design and a passion for visual narrative, I’m eager to apply my skills and immerse myself in real-world applications. Contact me below and let's tell a story~</p>
