        "Loliteen" is a single-edition magazine created as a group project for the course INFOSCI 309: Speculative and Critical Design in spring of 2023. It is a parodical commentary on 'grooming' and how pervasive it may or may not be in media and pop culture.

        It was developed in tandem with other products, including a stuffed toy set and a board game (not pictured). Currently, I am working on a more polished version of the magazine as a solo project, as we were limited by the 7-week timeframe.
